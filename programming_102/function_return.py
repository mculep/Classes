# #2
# Write a program that has a function named total_count that expects a list 
# of strings as it argument when the function is called.

# Have the returned value be a dictionary with the keys 'list_length' and 'total_chars'.
# The list_length value needs to be the length of the list and the total_chars 
# needs to be the total count of characters of all of the items in the array.
# Call the function 3 times with 3 different lists.
# (hint) len is usable on lists and strings.

# #expected output
# totals = total_count(['I', 'Am', 'Awesome'])
# print(totals) #{list_length:3, total_chars:10}
