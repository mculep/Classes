# Using our vehicle class from the previous lesson, add a speed, top_speed, 
# position, and acceleration attribute.
# speed and position should start at 0, top_speed and 
# acceleration are numbers.
# add a class method called move. When the move method is 
# called have the position increase by the speed of the car.
# add a class method called accelerate and using the very simplified 
# equation to have the vehicle accelerate when the accelerate method is called on that instance:
#  speed = speed + acceleration

# In the accelerate method, do not allow the vehicle to pass the top speed.
# modify the instances of the vehicles to include acceleration and top speed 
# when you instance the vehicles.
# using a while loop and assuming each iteration of the loop is a 
# 'second' have the vehicles 'race' by accelerating as much as possible on 
# a drag strip for 20, 40, and 60 seconds to see who wins.
# (challange) instead of racing for a timeframe, make the race different 
# distances. Position can be considered in meters.
